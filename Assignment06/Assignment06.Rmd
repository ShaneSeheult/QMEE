## 1. Measurement

## Question 1a:
**Theoretical Context:** The partiution date for animals can be climate depedent
**Emperical Relational Structure:** 
**Numerical Relational Structure:** 
**Meaningful Inferences:** 

## Question 1b:


## 2. Effect Sizes and Meaningful Magnitudes

## Question 2a:
Note, I will consider my continuous response variable to be *Birthday* (in yyyy-mm-dd) and my predictors to be *Group* (either Captive or Wild-Caught) which can be found in the dataframe *dd* 

For this data, I am examining the difference between birthdays between two groups - Captive and Wild-caught animals - to see if there is a meaningful effect of group on birthday. Note *Wild-Caught* animals were pups born from moms caught at a maternity roost in southern Ontario, Canada about threew eeks before partuition whereas *Captive* animals wree pups born from moms that had been in captivity for an extended period of time during hibernation and prior to partution. 

For this data, I believe the most appropriate measure of effect size would be **Cohen's d**. Note, Cohen's d scales the differences in mean between group by the pooled standard deviation, which serves as a measur of biological variation.

## Question 2b: 

## Question 2c:

## Question 2d:

## Question 2e:
```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, out.width= "400px", fig.cap=c("Figure 1: BoMM Figure included in Assignment")}
knitr::include_graphics("Figure01.png")
```
Below discusses my interpretation and inferences I would draw (do not forget about the counter null) from the following estimates:

**Estimate 1:** This estimate is a small, positive effect of mutant type 1. However, this estimate is not considered **meaningful** in biological context
**Estimate 2:**


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
