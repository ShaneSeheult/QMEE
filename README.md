This REPO is part of the requirements for BIOLOGY 708

This is the paragraph describing the dataset to be used for Assignment 01 in BIOLOGY 708.
Lactating mammals have variation in milk production and, in theory, this could lead to compeition for access
to the best milk source when mutlipe offspring nurse. In temperate North America, the big brown bat (ˆEptesisicus fuscusˆ)
gives birth to twin pups east of the Great Divide, making i a good model to study teat use and pup nursing. The purpose of 
this study was to examine the nursing behaviour and teat attachment of ˆE. fuscusˆ pups born to females of (1) a captive 
colony, and (2) wild-caught from a maternity colony in southern Ontario, Canada.
