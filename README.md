This is the paragraph describing the dataset to be used for Assignment 01 in BIOLOGY 708.

In temperate North America, big brown bats (Eptesisicus fuscus) give birth to twin pups 
east of the Great Divide. Big brown bats mate in the fall, and give birth during the summer.
The purpose of my study was to assess how pups born from females - caught at a maternity 
colony in southern Ontario, Canada - differ from pups born from females that have been in captivity 
for an extended period of time. Preliminary, I will assess if pups from wild-caught females and pups 
from captive females are born around the same time of year (using Julian Date). I will also view whether 
the proportion of same-sex siblings (i.e. male-male or female-female siblings) differ from 
the proportion of different-sex siblings (i.e. male-female).
