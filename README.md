This is the paragraph describing the dataset to be used for Assignment 01 in BIOLOGY 708.

In eastern temperate North America, big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) generally give birth to twin pups. The bats mate in the later summer and the fall. Females store sperm during the winter and when they emerge from hibernation in the early spring they ovulate and give birth about two months later. The purpose of this study was to assess and look for differences in the birth dates of pups born to females from two captive populations. One population were caught at a maternity colony in southern Ontario, Canada about three weeks before parturition. The second population of pups were born to females that been in captivity for an extended period of time during hibernation and prior to parturition. I will assess if pups from newly-captive wild-caught females have similar birth dates (Julian Date) compared to pups born to females that had been living in captivity for a longer period of time. I will also compare these populations to see if they differ in the proportion of same-sex siblings (i.e. male-male or female-female siblings) and different-sex siblings (i.e. male-female).
